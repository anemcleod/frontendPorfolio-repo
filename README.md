# frontend Porfolio

This is a react app that pulls dynamic content from a headless cms

I designed this site to promote myself, display my skills and allow potential employers easy access to my personal projects, github repos and general information.  

This site shows my ability to leverage flexbox to create a responsive layout that looks great on any device.  The integrated headless cms allows me to easily add or edit personal projects ensuring continuous use.
